 Bluetooth Adapter with ESP-32 to play Music

This is a simple Programm Snippet used to Control Music Playback with an ESP-32 and an AUX-Out.
Can be used for Cars :D

Now with Features to support two different Buttons that can be connected to the Esp-32.
- Skipping to next Song
- Going back one Song 

More can be connected, but not needed in my Use-Case.
